# Worklog

Newest entries first. Each entry names the roadmap task(s) it closes; the matching commit
carries the same task ID in its message (`git log --grep "P1.1"`).

## 2026-09-27 — P0.1, P0.2 · Rewrite kickoff

- Created the `v2` branch from `master` and removed all v1 sources (`api-server`,
  `client`, `scraper`, `scripts`, `docs`, `docker-compose.yml`, release workflows).
  v1 remains intact on `master`.
- Wrote [architecture.md](architecture.md), [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md) and this worklog.
- Decisions made with the maintainer:
  - Runtime in **Rust** (performance is the deciding criterion).
  - MTProto: **TL core now**, wire protocol in a later phase (P8).
  - Client in **React + TypeScript**; desktop via **bunium**.
  - Work happens on the `v2` branch of this repo, one commit per finished task.
- Decided independently (build-time only, no runtime impact): codegen written in
  TypeScript on Bun, generated code committed.
- Review of v1 that shaped the plan:
  - `client/src/components/Chat/TelegramChatPage.tsx` was 23k lines; handler files up to 5k.
  - Bot API handlers wrote straight to SQLite, with global message IDs and no MTProto layer.
  - Mini Apps were never rendered; no isolation between test runs; UI-only interaction.
  - Worth keeping: debug console ideas (request/response log, webhook viewer, JSON diff,
    trace export/import), runtime power/restart controls, broad feature scope
    (business, gifts, stories, suggested posts, checklists, boosts).
- Targets: Bot API 10.3 (current on core.telegram.org and in `telegram-bot-api`).
